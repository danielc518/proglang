  In this source file, you will find a number of comments containing the text
  "ANSWER".  Each of these comments indicates a portion of the source code you
  must fill in yourself.  You are welcome to include other functions for use in
  your answers.  Read the instructions for each problem and supply a segment of
  code which accomplishes the indicated task.  For your convenience, a number of
  test expressions are provided for each problem as well as a description of
  their expected values.

  In this assignment, you are permitted to complete the listed tasks using any
  of the OCaml modules/functions.  However you are still required to avoid the use of
  mutation unless explicitly specified in the question.

  1. For the next several problems, you will be asked to produce an expression which
     has a given type.  It does not matter what expression you provide as long as it
     has that type; there may be numerous (or even infinite) answers for each
     question.  Your answer may *not* produce a compiler warning.  You are *not*
     permitted to use explicit type annotations (such as "fun x:'a -> x").

     Exact type variable names do not count, but must be consistent. For
     example, "'a -> 'b -> 'b" and "'b -> 'a -> 'a" are considered the same,
     but "'a -> 'a -> 'b" is different from both of them. Also, "'_a" and "'a"
     are considered different.

  OCaml is an eager language. So you cannot create infinite lists/sequences directly. However you can
	encode them fairly easily in the language.
	
	For the purpose of this exercise we will encode (potentially) infinite lists using the following type.
*)
type 'a sequence = Nil | Sequence of 'a * (unit -> 'a sequence);;

(* As a hint, here how you would write a an infinite sequence of zeroes *)
let rec zeroes = Sequence(0, function () -> zeroes);;

(* And a finite sequence 1, 2 *)

(*
  2a. Write a function to convert a sequence to a list. Of course if you try to evaluate this on an infinite
	    sequence, it will not finish. But we will assume sanity on the caller's part and ignore that issue

  2b. While it is nice to have these infinite sequences, it is often useful to "cut" them to a fixed size. Write
	    a function that cuts off a sequence after a fixed number of values. The return value is a finite sequence
	    of the same type.
			
			(Treat the given count 'n' as the maximum number of elements allowed in the output sequence. So if the input
			is a finite sequence and its length is less than the specified count, the output sequence can have less than
			'n' values)

  2c. You can also encode finite sequences directly using the above type. For this question encode the sequence

  3a. Create a simple heap (priority queue) module that matches the interface provided below.

      In the section below, fill out the signature and the implementation details. You must explicitly leave any
      types in the signature abstract. (This is good practice in the software engineering sense. By not explicitly
      binding the types on the interface, you allow different implementations to choose types best suited
      for their goals)

      Your heap implementation does not need to be efficient.
      You are not permitted to just wrap the OCaml heap in this interface.

      You should use the generic compare function; there are better ways, but they're more
      complicated.

      NOTE: When you query the type of your functions in the top loop, it might return the fully qualified type signatures.
      E.g: empty : unit -> 'a GHeap.heap instead of just unit -> 'a heap. This is fine.

  5. Cache: Pure functions (those without side effects) always produces the same value
     when invoked with the same parameter. So instead of recomputing values each time,
     it is possible to cache the results to achieve some speedup.

     The general idea is to store the previous arguments the function was called
     on and its results. On a subsequent call if the same argument is passed,
     the function is not invoked - instead, the result in the cache is immediately
     returned.

     Note: you will need to use mutable state in some form to implement the cache.
